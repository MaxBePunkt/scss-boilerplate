# Sass Boilerplate

This is a sample project using the [7-1 architecture pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es) writing conventions.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

### Use with Sass

When using `sass` - in order to build that boilerplate, one needs to:

- install `sass` if not yet installed:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

- run build command from command line:

```bash
sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css
```
